# Target Shooter

I made this game back in 2011 (if the copyright notice I wrote is correct). I think I used some sort of file joiner to join the files so it's everyone on one file, and I have no idea where the original files are. Luckily the files were joined but not minified or mangled, so it's readable!

The whole thing is made in vanilla JS with the use of Canvas. I recall it was quite an fun experience to build and some people liked it. I even published it in the [Chrome Experiments page](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/target-shooter)!
